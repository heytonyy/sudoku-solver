## Sudoku Solver
#### by heytonyy(2022)

## Context
I did a LeetCode problem about solving a sudoku board. I had an idea. When I finish the algorithm, learn about machine learning/photo recognition. Make small front-end app where user uploads sudoku blank board --> image recognition to make the board to a 2x2 array, then use algorithm to solve.

## TODO:
Frontend:
- Form Component: image upload + display + submit button
- Output Component: display solution

Backend:
- work on croping algo (play with bw_img/morph/contour -- need for various shades of images)
